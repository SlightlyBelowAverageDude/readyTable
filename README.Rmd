# readyTable

`readyTable` helps you analyze and clean data frames more easily.  
It provides functions to detect issues such as missing values, constant columns, numeric‑like strings, and mixed types — and then apply cleaning actions in a controlled way.

---

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

```r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SlightlyBelowAverageDude/readyTable")

library(readyTable)

#create a bad data frame
df <- data.frame(
  age = c(25, 30, NA, 45),
  income = c(1000, NA, 2000, 1500),
  const_col = rep("x", 4),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

#Step 1: Analyzing issues and get suggestions
log <- suggest_cleaning(df)
log
#a tibble with suggested actions for each problematic column

#Step 2: Deciding which columns to fix
(see parameter explanation below for how to specify the columns)

#Step 3: Applying cleaning
cleaned_df <- apply_cleaning(df, change_specific_columns = c("age", "income"))
cleaned_df
#Returns the cleaned data frame
```

## Key Functions
analyze_table(df):
Analyze a data frame for missing values, constant columns, bad names, mixed types, etc.
Returns a tibble summarizing issues per column.

summarize_numeric(df):
Summarize numeric columns with stats (mean, median, skewness, etc.) and a recommended imputation method.

suggest_cleaning(df):
Generate a list of suggested cleaning actions (impute, drop, convert) based on diagnostics.

apply_cleaning(df, ...):
Apply cleaning actions to selected columns, with optional overrides.

### How to control which columns are cleaned
The function apply_cleaning() gives you flexibility in deciding which columns to process:

keep_specific_columns:
A character vector of the names of the columns that you want to keep as they are, without any cleaning actions.

change_specific_columns:
A character vector of the names of the columns that you want to clean.
If provided, only these columns will be considered for cleaning.

When both are empty:
If you don’t specify either parameter, apply_cleaning() will attempt to clean all columns.

When both are used:
You can use both together. If there is an overlap (a column appears in both lists), the function will stop and alert you.
